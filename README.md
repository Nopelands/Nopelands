### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at UFPE, I mostly write small personal projects whenever I want to learn a new concept or tool.

Here are some of my best projects:

- [**YanoServant**](https://github.com/Nopelands/YanoServant) - Named after a character played by a dear friend, this project gets the most active development, since it is in actual use whenever I'm DMing a D&D campaign. I used this to learn more about the Discord API, Parsers, Tokenizers, Formal Languages, and dealing with unfriendly user input.
- [**tictactoe**](https://github.com/Nopelands/tictactoe) - Tic-Tac-Toe AI designed to never lose a game. I used this to learn more about the minimax algorithm, recursion, and as a proof of concept for Tic-Tac-Toe being a mathematically solved game.
- [**chess**](https://github.com/Nopelands/chess) - The first steps towards building a chess CLI written in python. I used this to learn more about the inner workings of chess simulators.
- [**Portal of Monstrosities**](https://github.com/Nopelands/Portal-of-Monstrosities) - Prototype of a tool to automatically generate monsters complete with statblock and description for D&D 5e. I used this to learn more about NLP and python type hints.
- [**ipmt**](https://github.com/Nopelands/ipmt) - Pattern matching tool that I made with a friend for a string processing course. I used this to learn more about C++ CLI arguments, the inner workings of the deflate algorithm used by gzip, python's matplotlib library, and bash scripting.

I'm currently learning Rust, but there are no projects that I feel are worth sharing just yet.

If you're a Hardware Infrastructure student that has ended up here somehow, [this](https://github.com/Nopelands/mips-assembly) is probably what you are looking for.
